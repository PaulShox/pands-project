## About the Iris Dataset   
The Iris dataset, also know as Fischer's Iris dataset, is a collection of data about three species of the Iris flower. The data was published by Ronald Fisher in a 1936 paper.  

The three species of the flower are:   
- Iris setosa
- Iris virginica
- Iris versicolor   

Fifty samples from each of the species were examined using the following four measures:   
- Sepal Length
- Sepal Width
- Petal Length
- Petal Width

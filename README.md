# Iris Dataset Analysis

## About the Iris Dataset   
The Iris dataset, also know as Fischer's Iris dataset, is a collection of data about three species of the Iris flower. The data was published by Ronald Fisher in a 1936 paper.  

The three species of the flower are:   
- Iris setosa
- Iris virginica
- Iris versicolor   

Fifty samples from each of the species were examined using the following four measures:   
- Sepal Length
- Sepal Width
- Petal Length
- Petal Width

## About the Analysis
The analysis contains a Jupyter (.ipynb) file containing narrative about the analysis, and a python (.py) file with just the code used.

The analysis is divided into four sections:
- Section 1 is the importation of the various Python libraries to be used in the analysis. And the importation of the dataset itself.
- Section 2 is the generation of summary data for the dataset, at an overall level and at an individual species and measurement variable level. Also contained in this section is analysis of the average values of each species.
- Section 3 analyses the distributions of the values using histograms and Kernel Density Estimate plots.
- Section 4 is correlation analysis of the measurement values.
- Section 5 is a brief summary of the analysis.
